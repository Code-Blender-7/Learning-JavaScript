## 1. Introduction

Bankist is a web development tutorial project.

The project is part of a JavaScript course called "*The  Complete Javascript Course: From Zero to Expert*" made by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).

<i>Password - 1111</i>


The project itself can be found on the 11th section of the mentioned course.

According to the course, the index.html and style.css were created by default by Jonas where the script.js is what the enrolled developers have to create to make the website be functional from the buildup. 

To ensure the original author's authencitity, no code nor comment on the index.html and the style.css was made. The script.js is modified by me where I added numerous upgrade that is wayy advanced then the original final .js file.

## 3. How does it work?
The Bankist has two account database i.e two maps containing a series of values. The bankist project names the transactions as movements. For showing the transactions, the script.js changes the html of the website and displays the movements of the account by rows. 

The project starts with a "Login" page. Users have to input the correct username and the password to access the account. 
Passwords can be found at the beginning of the project while the usernames are created after user's full name.
Like - 
"Jonathan StackFlow" for js
</br>

<b>The Bankist can</b> - 
1. Send transaction from 1 database to another within script.js
2. Request loan i.e add sum to the account's balance.
3. Close account i.e delete the database if password matches.
4. Logout from account if user is inactive for 5 minutes
5. Display a clock label based on the real time and the locale provided inside the database. 
 
The bankist can also do other stuff like display IN's and OUT's of the transaction and as well as determine the interest rate of each transactions. 
By the word "*transactions*", I meant the additions and subtractions of the movement list. 

### <u>Modified functions -</u>
<u>The functions were modified to a scale where users would think that this is a complete project</u> -  
I added numerous changes like - 
1. Highlight INs and OUTs on the movements if clicked on the INs or OUTs label.
2. Added enchaned real time to label. The time would show seconds as well. 
3. Added a number of alert windows and changes to html to aware the user of activity that triggers an invalid input.
4. Added real time transactions and both interest and exchanges between USD and EUR currency.

<u>Below are a list of todo that are completed for the modified functions</u>

1. ✅<s>make transaction realisitc by converting Euros to USD </s>
2. ✅<s>Add real time user clock </s> 
3. ✅<s>Add new time color change where the timeout clock will turn red if less than 10 seconds</s>

Once again, .html and the .css are created by Jonas while I simply edited the script.js
