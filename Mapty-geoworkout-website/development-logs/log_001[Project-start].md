# Start


This is it. This is the last time that I am going this project. I have already deleted my previous files just to start everyone new. 


As you may not know, this project was on the verge of completion but what happened is that I was dumb that I didn't pay attention to the development. Therefore, I failed to complete the project on time which resulted in a failure. To overcome that failed attempt, I decided that I must ensure that this project is completed by the 20th of march....*additional days would be required for adding modifications beside the tutorial course.*


Let me also clarify that the project that I am doing right now is the Javascript course that i obtaianed from the udemy course site. I am serious of keeping the credits of the author intact. I am really not going to add that amount of new features of my own but I am doing this project for a long time and I really want to just finish this project as soon as possible. That's all.


Let's get started. For the second time. I am seriously not going to restart this project again.
