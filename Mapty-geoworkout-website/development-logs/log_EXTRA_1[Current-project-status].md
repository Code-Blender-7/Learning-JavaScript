# START

The past few days were tough for many classmates in my institution. Well, there had been nervous everywhere because the graduation exam is near. This is a exam that is too much of an importance. Because of that, I decided to pause the development of the JavaScript project for a while. It is a .... well it was a mistake. Because I felt the guilt of not doing my work. Leaving an unfinished work before my graduation exam? Hell no.


Thanks to my curiosity and some hard working hours, I was able to finish my book preparation and studies to a level where I be feeling confident. However it is still a shard in me that I couldn't finished my work. So I decided to finish it as fast as I can.

the project is updated with a new log and a new feature. This is called Progression. hehe.. I bet everyone would laugh saying that "OI! The exam is near and What the hell are you doing man?!". LOL, I don't know what to say. I will be saying like "it is better to finish what I started."

Either way, I am a developer, coder, programmer, a science geek, a bookworm and specially a fan when it comes to development of software. well I think I am getting a bit high right now. But that is the truth.

By the time I post this log, that means that I got to work hard for the next 36 days for my graduation exam. Let's do this the best we can.
