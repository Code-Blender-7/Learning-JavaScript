## Introduction
<h4>The Live-keyboard tracker is a website version of living tracking the keynotes pressed on the keyboard in real time. </br>
The program is quite an interesting idea while the whole code is very simple and beginner friendly.</h4>

You can find the working demo [here](https://twitter.com/Black_2_white/status/1389625972316467201)

I created this script because I needed it as reference for the future ***DOM*** works. </br>
Also because I am tend of forgetting ideas.
