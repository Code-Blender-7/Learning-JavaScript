This log is dedicated to the Slide Component of the Javascript Project....



One thing was for sure that the whole project of this section of this part cannot be build with the knowledge that i had. 

Jonas said that this project is gonna be BIG as hell.

the slide component was completed depended on CSS. I'll try to solve this with the simple mind.. if i can.


Contains of the slides are always completely irrevelent.

On the HTML file, there is a section that is commented out. the section is about pictures of a sort. The images of the slide component thou have a speciality on them. That is that there are always on top of each other. You can't find out that by using the images. That's why you need a textbox to do the trick.

For the sake of the design, I left them there without removing them. 
The images are located below the 'slider' div class.

Each of the slides are located over a slide transform value. The first slide is at slide 0%. The next slide is yet 100%. The next would be 200% and so on.

Adding an i as a index would be enough for the slide math to do the trick...
for example - 
1st slide - 100*0 = 0
2nd slide - 100*1 = 100
3rd slide - 100*2 = 200 

oh yeah, if you select the slider property class and set the transform scale to 0.5 then the content would be smaller.


for the slider btn change, i..i god i skip that one.
for now, use a calculator and inspect the value of the transform translateX.. i also am still figuring this out.


most of the slide component is completely math..
the actual concept of the slide component would be written off whenever i get the free time to log the report. 

After when i get the mood, i better start working on the log.. exclusively.
