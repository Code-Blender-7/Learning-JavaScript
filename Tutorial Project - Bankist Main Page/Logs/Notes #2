Selecting, Creating and Deleting Elements

Very hard topic. Said the instructor.

/// Selecting the HTML document

console.log(document.documentElement); // // Print the entire document.
console.log(document.head); // // Print the document head section only.
console.log(document.body); // // Print the document body section only.



USE querySelector to select the first occurance of the HTMLElements.
USE queySelectorAll to select all the occurance of the HTMLElements.

getElementsByTagName = ('button')
getElementByClassName = ('27')


####### CREATING AND EDITING STUFF

use the createElement to create any HTMLElement. The created element would appear on the elements tab of the inspection app but not on the remote file.

Use classlist.add to add classes to the created element like if the createElement was "div" and the classlist.add would be classlist.add('class--HighTower') then the element on the inspect app would show on the html <div class="class--HighTower">...</div>

add text or other stuff inside the element's ... by using the innerHTML of the created element like this


```
message.innerHTML = "We use cookies for improved functionality <button class="btn--close-cookie">Got it!</button>"
```

use header.prepend to insert the created element to the html. 

header.prepend = first child
header.append = last child

first child means the element is created in the upper top.
last child means the element is created in the lower part of the screen.
