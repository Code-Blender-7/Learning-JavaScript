syntax - getComputedStyle(element).property


it is the generated style that is created in the page. A computedStyle is not always like the CSS style.

It is recommended to use getComputedStyle to get accurate results and performance of the website

You may need to use parseFloat to change the data.



You can use JavaScript to inherit unused style from the css and set them on the js file.

Note that the JavaScript may always not be able to show if there is any issues while sharing the css style.




// However, you can read the dom by using getAttribute

console.log(logo.getAttribute('designer'))



Oh and rememeber that if you want to choose an element with a class name then you need to write it like ".element". 

If it was a HTMLElement then you can write it like "element"


NOTE that if a value is not found or present in the css, html which was defined in the js file then the result would be "undefined"

element.dataset.versionNumber is a special case of a DOM selection. For handling data, it's called a data attribute.


You can use the classes to add,remove,toggle or check if it "contains"



add => add a new attribute
remove => remove a attribute
toogle =>
