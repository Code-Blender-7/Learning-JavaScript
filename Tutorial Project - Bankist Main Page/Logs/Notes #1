These are the conventional notes that were acquired from the practice of the Section 13 of the JavaScript Course done by jonas.io 

################# START 

JavaScript uses DOM to interface with the Browsers like Chrome, Edge, Firefox etc. 

We can write JavaScript to create, edit, delete HTML elements. 

We can also set styles, classes, attributes and also listen/respond to events. 

We can use the DOM tree which is created from the HTML Document when executed and interact with it.io

DOM is a very complex API and it has a lot of methods and  properties to interact with the DOM Tree that was generated from the html Document.
API = Application Programming interface

examples - .querySelector(), .addEventListener(), .innerHTML() etc. 



### HOW IS DOM RECOGNIZED 

DOM works by using Nodes. Nodes are represented by their objects.io
Nodes are like Elements, Text, Comments, Documents. 

<p> </p> => elements
the text between the elements => text  
<!-- comments --> => Comments 
.querySelector, .createElements, .getElementById => Documents


HTMLElements - HTML elements can be of any type.  




DOM can work by using the *inheritance of methods and properties* method. 
Any HTMLElements will have their access to nodes like .addEventListener(), .cloneNode(), .closest()


DOM API are broken up into several types of nodes. JavaScript uses the Nodes to interact with DOM which will allow to interact with the HTML.

.addEventListener are used to listen and respond to the nodes.




In a document, all the other that doesn't need to interact with the DOM and HTML can be abstraction or irrevelent.
