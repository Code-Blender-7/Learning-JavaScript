This log is dedicated to the latest update of the change log on Oct 19th 2021 regarding about the Passing of argument to event handlers. 

The update was about the menu fade in and out. 

Here, if you try to add a class to a parentNode connected to a number of childNodes then the other childNodes would be affected. 
Also, the effect like the transistion is neutrilized in this process.

Mostly, the work was about there being to refactor the code. 

Turns out, the tutorial added the use of the 'bind' method. it was used as an alternative to reduce the code. However, it raised confussion and i was unable to 
completely add new arguments to the whole functions. 

In the end, I had to dissable the bind method and switch to the traditional arrow functions for it to work. 


The actions of this log is found in the section   ->  //// Navigation bar - toggle button fade in, fate out while hover

Meanwhile I just continue my pace then.
