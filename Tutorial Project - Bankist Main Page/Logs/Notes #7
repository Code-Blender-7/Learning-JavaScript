The idea of adding Event delegation and using the page navigation.

a href element's value has a nickname called anchor.
if the user clicks it then the webview is navigated to the href value address.

REMEMBER. You can't add a function to all the querySelectorAll at once.
Use the forEach() and add a function that calls a addEventListerner to make it work.


use the preventDefault to suppress the href anchor ceasing the default page navigation to not work.
rememeber that preventDefault will disable the default page navigation. not the custom changed one.


get the attribute name of any class or element by using the getAttribute(attribute) syntax.


adding more eventhandler to a large number of events causes less performance.

that's where the event delegation takes place.

use the function.target.classList.contains('class') to find out if the class element has the childnode class.
 
always use the e.preventDefault in case that you are adding your own behavior and overriding the default
