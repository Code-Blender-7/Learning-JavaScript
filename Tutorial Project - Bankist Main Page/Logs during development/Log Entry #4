After the studying of the behavior of the main website, It is time to work witht eh main website starting with the features first. 
Did learned how the whole HTMLElements are selected and then they are edited in the javascript file. 

However, I did found a quite number of class issues since the HTML script is not written by me. I be sure to fix them and try to include them in my log.



elements could be selected via a number of ways. They can all be selected by the
 document.querySelector('element' )
syntax. Also, they can be selected by using the 'getElementbyTagName', 'getElementByClassName' etc. etc.

element.getBoundingClientRect() is a function that shows the true coordinates of the element on the user computer. 

getBoundingClientRect() is also very responsive as well.


use window.pageXOffset to find the scroll width from the screen.
use window.pageYOffset to find the scroll height from the screen.


[ SOME REVELENT lessons relating about the 'old school method of scrolling' were not taken within the logs ]

Recently after working with the 'innerHTML', I found out some facts,
the innerHTML doesn't work like a normal JavaScript line. It accepts only HTML syntax. That means that if you want to turn a statement into a multiline then what you have to do is to add
the <br> statement. Not the /n statement.
