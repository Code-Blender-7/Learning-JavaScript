# Introduction.

Bankist Main Page is a tutorial project that can be found from the JavaScript course that was done by author [@jonasschmedtman](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman). 

The Bankist Main Page is created to test out and implement the javascripts skills and the DOM skills at the same time. 

Multiple of the features of the project were taken inactive in the course starter file. The objective was to enable the features using only the DOM and not touching the CSS or the HTML. All of it must be taken on the JavaScript file. 





This repository folder is still new and the readme.md files are yet to be updated. 

Please be patient.
