## Program Overview
The "Guess the Number" is a website based html program with user Interface using **DOM** [*Document Object Model*]
I really loved the program idea so I decided to enhance it by coding and adding more features. The main .html and .css designs were done by Jonas.io. I simply modified the JavaScript :)
### Files Structure - 
1. index.html - Main HTML File required to run the program
2. style.css - Main CSS file for HTML designing and DOM linking
3. script.js - Main JavaScript file required for website page to add feature controls over HTML file.
