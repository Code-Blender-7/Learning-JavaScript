## Program Overview
The "Guess the Number" is a website based html program with user Interface using **DOM** [*Document Object Model*]
I really loved the program idea so I decided to enhance it by coding and adding more features. The main .html and .css designs were done by Jonas.io. I simply modified the JavaScript :)
### Files Structure - 
1. index.html - Main HTML File required to run the program
2. style.css - Main CSS file for HTML designing and DOM linking
3. script.js - Main JavaScript file required for website page to add feature controls over HTML file.

## How to run it? ðŸ“‘
Well, unless you are a newbie and new to web development. You have to download the files on the "***Guess the Number***" directory. </br>
If you know how to use git then you can try this on your command terminal - 

```
git clone Learning-JavaScript
```
