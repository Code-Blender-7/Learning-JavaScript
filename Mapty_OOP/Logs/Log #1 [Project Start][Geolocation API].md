Can't believe that I am literally starting out the enw project called the mapty. 

this is going to be AWESOME!

First of, the geolocation api is awesome. looks like people found out the way to track the location of a user using the location access.
it doens't tell the exact location. just the coords of it. 

the syntax feels weird but I can manage it.
