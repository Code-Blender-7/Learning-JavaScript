This is the 2nd log of the Mapty API.

The Leaflet API is a customizable API that ...displays maps?
Funny to even realize that such an API even exists in the first place.


After that, I came to realize that API can be downloaded using the npm command line that I downloaded. I keep that in mind. 


Onwards is the API itself.
Well, its a link. that's it. A link.

That link better connects to the API itself. I included the settings of the map display on the [script.js](https://github.com/Code-Blender-7/Learning-JavaScript/blob/main/Mapty_OOP/Program_files/script.js).

The code of the leaflet had a map object data style where there were a number of objects. Of course, I do know my experience with OOP. they just did it for the sake of better readability.

The map database had a tileLayer which is actually used for changing the style of the map. its called tileLayer because the map is created using tiles.

The next is a marker that is a CSS style. It will place a marker based on the postion of the coordinates. 


i'll manage the file folder structure now. Looks like a mess to me.
