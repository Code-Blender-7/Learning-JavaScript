This log is dedicated to the Project Architecture of any project development and as well as discussion of the mapty project.


# START

Every project starts with an architecture that serves as the structure of the main program. First of all, all projects is about data. Without data, it sure isn't a project. the main architecture of the project is sure large that it be hard to include them in the log. 

It is simply that the input data is used to be inherited to other functions like the running and the cycling input. 

Until now, we are having 5 types of event handling incidents. They include load page, receive position, click on map, change input and submit form. 

here all the inputs will create a huge influx of data that eventually creates a new class where all the data are stored.

Words and the logs are too less to completely cover the whole form of the logs. It is better to add actions than words.
