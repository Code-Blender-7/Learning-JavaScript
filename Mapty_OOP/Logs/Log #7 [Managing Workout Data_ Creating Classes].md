This log is dedicated to the creation of the workout parent class and the other child classes.

### START

I can be sure that I did undergo this training of using the constructor as a parent class on the child classes. Basically if I were to explain it then it will be something like the a constructor function that extends its attributes to other constructors. The extension of the attributes would make them be child nodes. To initialize the attributes, we use the super() method.


Here at the beginning of the parent, jonas had created 2 variables of date and id. After running these two would be a part of the constructor's object data. That means that we can use this tactics as an advantage to code some functional.
