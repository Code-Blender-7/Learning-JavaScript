This is the beginning of the Log #3 of the Mapty.API project. 


Due to a sudden debate regarding of my academic results and performance, I decided that I should shut down all my projects and my tutorial sessions because well... my time keeping of my programming are not on good.


I decided to shut down or more like pospond my projects till April. And after a lot of hard work, I decided to resume my programs. 
It was a stall of both time and knowledge for me. yet this break was worth it.
