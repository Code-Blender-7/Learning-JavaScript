This log is dedicated to the refactoring of the project with the architecture.

### START

After the long hiatus, we are back. The code is already the same and it is in the standstill. Jonas said that the code that was in the script were messy and to fix it, we need to create a constructor with functions and then move the code there, connect them and seperate their congestion together. 

The outcome is that we can develop the software more accurately. By the time you are reading this and the project is finished, I presume that the readme that was given is already edited with the included images. The following readme would have the architecture image that the whole new ractoring is based upon.

Jonas did say that a regular function call is called an error. I think.

he used the bind function where the method creates a new function. 
The bind function will have to be used in many fields to ensure that the functions would be connected with each other. i.e to use bind method.

the whole point of the refactoring including the use of the javscript bind function.
I better start working with the JavaScript Bind method and constructor functions to get the full glimsp of it. Maybe use JavaScript. info website for that.
