## About

The mapty is a JavaScript/HTML/CSS based project that uses the leaflet API to plot your workout details on a map anywhere on the globe. Mapty Workout is a tutorial project that is made by the author Jonas Schmedtmann. You can say that I am the student that wrote the JavaScript code. 

Be sure to visit the [logs](https://github.com/Code-Blender-7/Learning-JavaScript/tree/main/Mapty-Workouts-App/development-logs) so that you can track the development of the project. *Sorry for my bad writing skills in advance.*

## Getting Started

The project requires your location access and as well as your internet connection. Afterwards, just follow the installation content given below to make the app work.

### Prerequisites

Mapty Workouts App requires no external or special downloads. Just be sure to have a modern and updated browser that supports all the features of the JavaScript language.


### Installing

As of now, this project is located in a repository with other kinds of projects. This project does not have its own repository *yet*.

But instead of cloning the whole project, you can download this project using the Downgit external website. Afterwards, just run the index.html to run the site.

## Usage

When the project starts, there will be various values that determine the information regarding of your workout that you want to save in the project app. 
First, click anywhere on the map once it loads up and then enter the info of your workout. A marker is placed afterwards in the point where you plotted.
You can also click any tables on the left side of the app so that it will automatically change the view of the map to the position of your marker.


<s>[You can view the project using this link here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Code-Blender-7/Learning-JavaScript/blob/main/Mapty-Workouts-App/index.html)</s>. *The site of the online preview will render the HTML and CSS but the JS code will be failed to execute. There is perhaps no choice but to run this program locally as of now.*
