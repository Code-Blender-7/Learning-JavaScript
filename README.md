# Everything about this Repository

There is no doubt that JavaScript is my second language that I started out in the second round of the #100daysOfCode.

While exploring JavaScript, I'll liked the idea of creating my own websites and my own designs. Since with python, You can't do that musch. JavaScript/HTML/CSS would be that key. If there is any kind of research file that I find myself interested in, I can't afford but to share it with the community. ðŸ’œ

that's what this whole repository is all about. It stores all the works in my adventure to JavaScript. Each File should have their own readme and demo links to twitter. Be sure to check em out and share your thoughts with the community. 

Thanks a lot.
